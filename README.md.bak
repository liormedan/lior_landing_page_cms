This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Email Setup (SendGrid)

To enable sending emails from the contact form, set these env vars:

- `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY=...`
- `FROM_EMAIL=you@domain.com`
- `FROM_NAME=Your Name` (optional)
- `TO_EMAIL=dest@domain.com` (where to receive leads)
- `SEND_CONFIRMATION=true` (optional, also emails the sender)

Without these, the API logs submissions to the console in development.

## Sanity CMS Setup

This project reads blog content from Sanity using `next-sanity`.

- Create a Sanity project at https://www.sanity.io and obtain:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
- Optionally create a read token for draft/preview support and set `SANITY_READ_TOKEN`.
- Set the variables in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`).

Environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=...`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production`
- `SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-10-05`
- `SANITY_READ_TOKEN=` (optional)
- `SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET=blog-preview-secret` (optional)

Blog content model expected:

- `post` with fields: `title`, `slug`, `excerpt`, `publishedAt`, `featured`, `mainImage`, `body`, `seo` (optional)
- `author` with fields: `name`, `slug`, `role`, `avatar`, `bio`
- `category` with fields: `title`, `slug`

You can manage drafts/published states and categories directly in your Sanity Studio. If you don’t have a Studio embedded here, host one separately or add one under `/studio` (requires adding `sanity` package and config).

## SEO & RTL

- RTL is globally enabled (`lang="he" dir="rtl"`) in `app/layout.tsx:20`.
- `app/robots.ts` and `app/sitemap.ts` are included. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in your env so these generate correct absolute URLs.

## Quote/Leads CTA

The primary CTA in the hero is set to "קבל/י הצעה" and the contact form posts to `/api/contact`. Configure email provider (SendGrid or Resend) to receive leads by email.
